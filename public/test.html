The Innoblue Accelerator Team will assign each team a coach who will guide the teams through the accelerator’s weekly workshops and help prepare them for the Startup Showcase. Through the accelerator, the ventures will have access to invaluable resources and pro bono services addressing growth hacking/marketing, financial projection, legal advisory, and many other services within the State College community. At the end of the accelerator, the ventures will have the opportunity to network with industry experts and pitch to potential investors at the Startup Showcase. The Innoblue Team looks forward to accelerating these ventures in the coming weeks so be sure to check the blog each week to see their progress!

                            Our first focus is on keeping people hydrated. Staying hydrated helps you stay healthy, and information on what you’re putting into your body is important. Many people are chronically dehydrated, and mistreat the symptoms using coffee and medicine when they really need water. This is where we come in.

                            The two Penn State attendees were inspired by the lively down town atmosphere in State College, PA. The two began to formalize an idea that would connect the concepts of social media to nightlife entertainment. On a gloomy November evening in Happy Valley, at a tailgating event before a Penn State football game, the idea was born.
